<p>This problem is a little more complicated than the previous one. You have to get all of the answers right in order to get the final answer.</p>
<h3>Stage 0:</h3>
<p>This stage is just like the last problem. Just plug the numbers into <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=9.81*800*ln(50%2F30)" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="http://bing.lmgtfy.com/?q=9.81*800*ln(50%2F30)" target="_blank">Bing.</a></p>
<h3>Stage 1:</h3>
<p>This one is a little more tricky, and it's actually more tricky than it needs to be. First, you want to add the wet mass of the stage above it to both the wet and dry masses. You end up with this:</p>
<ul><li>Wet Mass: 80 tons + 50 tons = 130 tons</li>
<li>Dry Mass: 30 tons + 50 tons = 80 tons</li>
<li>Specific Impulse: 290 (I<sub>sp</sub> doesn't care what the mass is, or what the engine above it is doing)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you just plug these new values into <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=9.81*290*ln(130%2F80)" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com/?q=9.81*290*ln(130%2F80)" target="_blank">Bing.</a></p>
<h3>Stage 2:</h3>
<p>Stage 3 follows the same process as stage 2, but now you have to add on the mass of both stages to both your dry and wet masses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wet Mass: 80 tons + 50 tons + 100 tons = 230 tons</li>
<li>Dry Mass: 80 tons + 50 tons + 35 tons = 165 tons</li>
<li>Specific Impulse: 285 (I<sub>sp</sub> still doesn't care what the mass is, or what the I<sub>sp</sub>  of non-firing engines is. It never will)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you simply plug these numbers into the formula in either <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=9.81*285*ln(230%2F165)" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="http://tinyurl.com/qays8hb" target="_blank">Bing.</a></p>
<h3>Total delta-v:</h3>
<p>This is the easiest part of the whole problem. All you have to do is add up the values for the delta-v for every stage. You can plug this into <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=4009%2B1381%2B929" target="_blank">Google</a> or <a href="http://letmebingthatforyou.com/?q=4009%201381%20929" target="_blank">Bing</a> too if you'd like, or use a simple calculator.</p>
<p>And you're done!</p>
